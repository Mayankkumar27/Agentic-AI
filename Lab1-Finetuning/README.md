📌 Lab Title
Fine-Tuning BLIP on an Image Captioning Dataset

📖 Overview

This lab focuses on fine-tuning the BLIP (Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining) model for the task of image captioning. Image captioning is a multimodal problem that combines computer vision and natural language processing to generate descriptive text for images.

The notebook demonstrates how a pre-trained BLIP model can be adapted to a specific dataset to improve caption quality and contextual understanding.
